# Email Verification System â€“ GitHub Timeline Updates

This project is a pure PHP-based email verification system where users:

âœ… Enter their email to register  
âœ… Receive a 6-digit code for verification  
âœ… Get GitHub timeline updates via email every 5 minutes (via CRON job)  
âœ… Can unsubscribe via a secure verification link

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
- Uses `registered_emails.txt` for verified users
- HTML email formatting
- GitHub timeline fetched and emailed (every 5 mins)
- Unsubscribe via link + code verification
- All logic inside `src/` (no database, no external libraries)

ðŸ§° Built with core PHP, HTML, and a CRON job  
ðŸ§  Follows assignment structure and naming conventions exactly
